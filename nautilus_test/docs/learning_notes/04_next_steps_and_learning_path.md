## Key Learning Resources

### Documentation to Study
1. **NautilusTrader Docs**: Core concepts and API reference
2. **Example Strategies**: Pattern recognition and best practices
3. **Configuration Files**: Understanding system setup

### Code to Explore
1. **Start with**: `/nt_reference/examples/backtest/`
2. **Study**: Strategy implementations in `/nt_reference/nautilus_trader/examples/strategies/`
3. **Reference**: Adapter implementations for market connections

### Practical Exercises

#### Week 1: Foundation
- [ ] Create and run a simple strategy
- [ ] Modify strategy parameters and observe results
- [ ] Understand profit/loss calculations

#### Week 2: Data & Backtesting
- [ ] Work with different data types (bars, ticks)
- [ ] Run multi-day backtests
- [ ] Generate performance reports

#### Week 3: Real Markets
- [ ] Connect to sandbox/testnet environments
- [ ] Handle live market data feeds
- [ ] Implement basic monitoring

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Strategy Development
1. **Over-optimization**: Don't curve-fit to historical data
2. **Ignoring Transaction Costs**: Include realistic fees and slippage
3. **Look-ahead Bias**: Only use data available at decision time
4. **Insufficient Testing**: Test across different market conditions

### Risk Management
1. **Position Sizing**: Never risk more than you can afford to lose
2. **Correlation**: Understand how assets move together
3. **Drawdown Planning**: Prepare for losing streaks
4. **Leverage**: Start with low or no leverage

### Technical Issues
1. **Data Quality**: Validate incoming market data
2. **Connectivity**: Handle network failures gracefully
3. **System Resources**: Monitor memory and CPU usage
4. **Version Control**: Track all strategy changes
