# PPO: Project Prime Objective

- Design OHLCV-turning self-adaptive Nonparametric Predictive Alpha Factor ("NPPAF") that's Self-Adaptive Generative Evaluation ("SAGE").
- SAGE is quantitatively and adaptively assessed through parameter-free, regime-aware evaluation frameworks that discover optimal performance criteria from market structure rather than relying on fixed thresholds, ensuring robust nonparametric out-of-sample viability across market variations.

## Project Resources

## Research Documentation

- **Research Folder**: `docs/research/` - Theoretical foundation and algorithm taxonomy for NPAF/SAGE framework
  - **Motivation**: Research genesis and problem statement documentation
  - **Algorithm Taxonomy**: State-of-the-art parameter-free adaptive algorithms categorization (2024-2025)
  - **Implementation Pointers**: Future references for updating `docs/roadmap/` with practical NT-native methods

## FPPA: FinPlot Pattern Alignment

- FinPlot pattern is in the `/Users/terryli/eon/nt/repos/finplot`.
- Prefer `/Users/terryli/eon/nt/repos/finplot/finplot/examples/complicated.py` as the default template.
- Proactively conform to the native paradigm of FinPlot—including its provided classes, idiomatic patterns, and native conventions.

## NTPA: NautilusTrader Pattern Alignment

- NautilusTrader pattern is in the `/Users/terryli/eon/nt/repos/nautilus_trader`.
- Proactively conform to the native paradigm of NautilusTrader—including its provided classes, idiomatic patterns, and native conventions.

## Financial Time Series Trading Optimization

- Recommend 2025 state-of-the-art, benchmark-validated, top-ranked algorithms implemented in off-the-shelf, future-proof, turnkey Python libraries that require minimal or no manual tuning—avoiding hardcoded thresholds or magic numbers. In other words, prioritize generalizability, auto-tuning capabilities, and integration-friendliness.

- Proactively research recent best practices for the host framework's native paradigm—including its provided classes, idiomatic patterns, and native conventions—and present your findings as a concise, reproducible, cookbook‑style reference.

- Proactively conform to the native paradigm of NautilusTrader—including its provided classes, idiomatic patterns, and native conventions.

## Output

- Minimize the number of lines by using Rich Progress and related functions.

## AFPOE: Advices from Panel of Experts

- You are to ultrathink like "Quant of the Year Award" winners Jean-Philippe Bouchaud, Maureen O'Hara, Riccardo Rebonato, Petter Kolm, Campbell R. Harvey. and Marcos López de Prado to recommand state of the art novel follow-up design actions.

# important-instruction-reminders

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (\*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
Always verify data source authenticity before questioning calculation accuracy.
