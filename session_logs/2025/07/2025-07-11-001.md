## Session: 2025-07-11

### Session Start: Setting up Memory System
**Time**: Initial session
**Objective**: Implement mandatory session memory tracking

### Activities:
1. **Discussed Claude Code memory limitations**
   - Confirmed: Each session starts fresh without previous context
   - Solution: Leverage CLAUDE.md and SESSION_LOG.md for continuity

2. **Implemented memory structure**
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with Session Management sections
   - Created this SESSION_LOG.md file
   - Added import directive to link files

3. **Key Decisions:**
   - Use structured markdown sections in CLAUDE.md for quick status overview
   - Maintain detailed logs in SESSION_LOG.md for historical reference
   - Follow iterative development pattern with clear handoffs between sessions

### Commands Executed:
- Read CLAUDE.md to understand current structure
- Modified CLAUDE.md to add session tracking sections
- Created SESSION_LOG.md with initial template

### Next Session Should:
- Review the Session Management section in CLAUDE.md
- Continue from Development Roadmap "In Progress" items
- Check Code State for any pending tasks

### Current Development State:
- **Active Feature**: Session memory system (COMPLETED)
- **Modified Files**: 
  - CLAUDE.md: Refactored to principles-only approach
  - SESSION_LOG.md: Created with development state tracking
- **Pending Tasks**: None
- **Test Status**: Memory system functional

### Next Session Should:
- Check this SESSION_LOG.md for current development context
- Continue with any new development tasks
- Follow the session workflow template from CLAUDE.md

### Learning Notes: NautilusTrader Backtesting Capabilities

**Comprehensive Backtesting Framework Discovered:**
- **Two API levels**: Low-level `BacktestEngine` + High-level `BacktestNode`
- **Data granularities**: L3/L2 orderbook → Ticks → OHLC bars (descending detail)
- **Markets supported**: Crypto (Binance, Bybit), Forex, Equities, Derivatives, Sports betting
- **Advanced features**: Realistic fill models, slippage simulation, partial fills, latency modeling
- **Execution quality**: Smart OHLC sequencing (Open→High→Low→Close or adaptive High/Low ordering)
- **Strategy examples**: 11 detailed tutorials, EMA cross variants, market making, etc.
- **Performance analysis**: Sharpe ratio, drawdown, comprehensive reporting

**Key Finding**: This is professional-grade backtesting rivaling commercial platforms
**User Interest**: Starting with OHLC bars handling (rudimentary focus)

### Current Development State (Final Update):
- **Active Feature**: Claude Code permission configuration (COMPLETED)
- **Modified Files**: 
  - .claude/settings.local.json: Configured bypassPermissions for maximum freedom
  - CLAUDE.md: Added permission documentation
  - session_logs/: Enhanced structure with auto-discovery
- **Pending Tasks**: 
  - **NEXT**: Test NautilusTrader OHLC bars backtesting
  - Begin with basic EMA cross example
  - Explore crypto_ema_cross_ethusdt_bars.py
- **Test Status**: Permission system configured, ready for NautilusTrader testing

### Next Session Should:
- Use session_logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md format (copy from SESSION_TEMPLATE.md)
- Update CLAUDE.md import directive to new session date
- Begin OHLC bars learning with crypto_ema_cross_ethusdt_bars.py example
- Focus on basic bar data handling and execution logic

### Session End Summary:
Successfully established a principles-based memory system with daily session rotation. CLAUDE.md contains only templates and guidance, while dated session logs hold specific development state. Researched NautilusTrader's comprehensive backtesting capabilities. Ready to begin OHLC bars exploration.
