# SAGE Methodology Framework: Self-Adaptive Generative Evaluation (2025)

## Pioneering Research Opportunity

**Critical Discovery**: As of 2025, SAGE (Self-Adaptive Generative Evaluation) methodology **does not exist in published quantitative finance literature**. This represents a significant opportunity to pioneer a new field in adaptive trading algorithm evaluation.

## SAGE Framework Definition

**Self-Adaptive Generative Evaluation (SAGE)** is a novel methodology enabling trading strategies to discover their own evaluation criteria from market structure evolution, eliminating dependence on fixed performance thresholds and static benchmarks.

### Core Principles

1. **Self-Discovery**: Performance criteria emerge from market data patterns rather than analyst assumptions
2. **Generative Modeling**: Counterfactual scenario generation for robust strategy evaluation  
3. **Adaptive Evolution**: Evaluation framework continuously adapts to changing market conditions
4. **Parameter-Free Operation**: No manual threshold setting or hyperparameter tuning required

## Theoretical Foundation

### Information-Theoretic Basis

**Market Structure Information Content**
- Market regimes contain inherent information about optimal evaluation criteria
- Mutual information between market states and strategy performance guides criterion selection
- Entropy measures quantify evaluation criterion stability across market conditions

**Mathematical Framework**:
```
I(E; M) = ∑∑ p(e,m) log(p(e,m)/(p(e)p(m)))
```
Where:
- E = Evaluation criteria space
- M = Market state space  
- I(E; M) = Mutual information between evaluation criteria and market states

### Generative Evaluation Architecture

**Phase 1: Criterion Discovery**
```python
class CriterionDiscovery:
    """Discovers optimal evaluation criteria from market structure"""
    
    def discover_criteria(self, market_data, strategy_outcomes):
        # Information-theoretic analysis of market-performance relationships
        # Identifies evaluation metrics with highest information content
        # Returns adaptive criteria without fixed thresholds
        pass
```

**Phase 2: Counterfactual Generation**  
```python
class CounterfactualGenerator:
    """Generates alternative market scenarios for robust evaluation"""
    
    def generate_scenarios(self, base_market_conditions):
        # VAE-based market scenario generation
        # Creates counterfactual conditions for strategy testing
        # Enables evaluation against unobserved market states
        pass
```

**Phase 3: Adaptive Evaluation**
```python
class AdaptiveEvaluator:
    """Continuously adapts evaluation framework"""
    
    def evaluate_strategy(self, strategy, market_regime, generated_scenarios):
        # Applies discovered criteria to strategy performance
        # Adjusts evaluation based on market regime evolution
        # Returns regime-aware performance assessment
        pass
```

## Implementation Methodology

### Stage 1: Market Structure Analysis

**Regime-Aware Information Extraction**
1. **Spillover Network Detection**: Cross-asset correlation patterns signal regime boundaries
2. **Entropy-Based Classification**: Natural market state identification without predefined categories  
3. **Information Decay Analysis**: Optimal evaluation timeframes emerge from information content

**Technical Approach**:
- Wasserstein distance between performance distributions across regimes
- Mutual information decay for automatic lookback period selection
- Network topology changes as regime switching indicators

### Stage 2: Criterion Meta-Learning

**Self-Supervised Learning of Evaluation Metrics**
1. **Contrastive Learning**: Market state representations learned through positive/negative regime pairs
2. **meta-Information Weighting**: Evaluation criteria weights based on information content vs. historical performance
3. **Adaptive FDR Control**: Real-time multiple testing correction learning from evaluation history

**Meta-Learning Architecture**:
```python
class EvaluationMetaLearner:
    """Learns what constitutes good performance from market context"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.regime_encoder = RegimeEncoder()  # Contrastive learning for market states
        self.criterion_network = CriterionNetwork()  # Maps regimes to evaluation criteria
        self.adaptation_engine = AdaptationEngine()  # Updates criteria based on outcomes
    
    def learn_evaluation_mapping(self, historical_data):
        # Maps market regimes to appropriate evaluation criteria
        # Uses meta-learning to discover regime-criterion relationships
        # Continuously adapts based on market evolution
        pass
```

### Stage 3: Generative Robustness Testing

**Counterfactual Market Scenario Generation**
1. **VAE Market Modeling**: Generate alternative market conditions for strategy stress testing
2. **Distributional Robustness**: Evaluate strategy performance across generated market distributions
3. **Regime Interpolation**: Test strategy behavior in transition periods between known regimes

**Generative Framework**:
```python
class MarketScenarioVAE:
    """Variational Autoencoder for market condition generation"""
    
    def encode_market_state(self, ohlcv_data, regime_indicators):
        # Encodes market conditions into latent representation
        # Captures essential market structure information
        pass
    
    def generate_counterfactuals(self, base_conditions, n_scenarios):
        # Generates alternative market scenarios
        # Maintains realistic market dynamics constraints
        # Returns diverse scenarios for robust evaluation
        pass
```

## SAGE Integration with NPAF Framework

### Nonparametric Predictive Alpha Factor Enhancement

**Traditional NPAF Limitations**:
- Fixed evaluation criteria (Sharpe ratio, Information ratio)
- Static performance thresholds  
- Regime-agnostic evaluation methodology

**SAGE-Enhanced NPAF**:
- **Dynamic Criteria Discovery**: Optimal alpha factor evaluation metrics emerge from market data
- **Regime-Adaptive Assessment**: Different market conditions use appropriate evaluation frameworks
- **Generative Validation**: Alpha factors tested against counterfactual market scenarios

### Implementation Architecture

```python
class SAGEEnhancedNPAF:
    """NPAF with Self-Adaptive Generative Evaluation"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.npaf_core = NonparametricPredictiveAlphaFactor()
        self.sage_evaluator = SAGEFramework()
        self.regime_detector = SpilloverNetworkDetector()
    
    def generate_adaptive_alpha(self, market_data):
        # Generate alpha factor using NPAF methodology
        base_alpha = self.npaf_core.generate_factor(market_data)
        
        # Apply SAGE evaluation framework
        current_regime = self.regime_detector.detect_regime(market_data)
        evaluation_criteria = self.sage_evaluator.discover_criteria(market_data, current_regime)
        
        # Generative robustness testing
        counterfactual_scenarios = self.sage_evaluator.generate_scenarios(market_data)
        robust_alpha = self.sage_evaluator.evaluate_robustness(base_alpha, counterfactual_scenarios)
        
        return robust_alpha, evaluation_criteria
```
