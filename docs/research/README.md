# Research Documentation

## Overview

This folder contains research documentation supporting the development of **OHLCV-turning self-adaptive Nonparametric Predictive Alpha Factor (NPAF)** with **Self-Adaptive Generative Evaluation (SAGE)** framework.

## Research Philosophy

**"The strategy should discover its own evaluation criteria from market structure rather than inherit our biases about what matters."**

## Folder Organization

### Core Documents

- **[research_motivation.md](./research_motivation.md)** - Research genesis, problem statement, and driving philosophy behind the NPAF/SAGE framework
- **[adaptive_algorithm_taxonomy_2024_2025.md](./adaptive_algorithm_taxonomy_2024_2025.md)** - Comprehensive categorization of state-of-the-art parameter-free adaptive algorithms

## Research Motivation

### Problem Statement
Traditional threshold-based evaluation metrics assume market stationarity - a fundamentally false premise leading to strategy failure during regime changes.

### Solution Direction
Develop truly parameter-free, self-adaptive systems that:
- Eliminate hardcoded thresholds and magic numbers
- Adapt evaluation criteria based on market regimes
- Maintain robustness across market variations
- Ensure practical implementation viability

## Algorithm Taxonomy Categories

### 1. Temporal Adaptation Paradigms
- Meta-Temporal Learning (AlphaForge, QuantFactor REINFORCE)
- Multi-Scale Regime Detection (Adaptive Regime, Markov Autoregressive)

### 2. Nonparametric Learning Architectures  
- Self-Adaptive Local Learning (SLLM, Bayesian Nonparametric)
- Information-Theoretic Adaptation (Mutual Information, Entropy-Based)

### 3. Parameter-Free Optimization Frameworks
- Strongly-Adaptive Online Learning (Dynamic Regret, Model Selection)
- Implicit Parameter Evolution (Truncated Linear, Scale-Free)

### 4. Ensemble Intelligence Categories
- Incremental Forecast Fusion (IFF-DRL, Composite Alpha)
- Meta-Reinforcement Strategy Optimization (Cognitive Game Theory, Automated Generation)

### 5. Risk-Adjusted Robustness Evaluation
- Distributional Robustness (Mann-Whitney U, Kolmogorov-Smirnov)
- Multi-Hypothesis Correction (Deflated Metrics, Meta-Labeling)

## Implementation Pathway

### Research to Practice Pipeline
1. **Algorithm Investigation** - Deep dive into each taxonomy category
2. **NT-Native Adaptation** - Convert SOTA algorithms to NautilusTrader paradigms
3. **Integration Testing** - Cross-category algorithmic combinations
4. **Real-World Validation** - Multi-regime, multi-asset testing
5. **Continuous Evolution** - Ongoing algorithm monitoring and integration

### Documentation Updates
Research findings should systematically update implementation documentation in:
- `docs/roadmap/` - Implementation planning and refactoring roadmaps
- Project strategies - Practical NT-native algorithm implementations
- Testing frameworks - Validation methodologies
