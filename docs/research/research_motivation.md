# Research Motivation: NPAF/SAGE Framework

## Core Problem Statement

**Critical Issue**: Traditional threshold-based evaluation metrics (Sortino ratio > 1.5, t-stats > 3.0) are fundamentally flawed because they assume market stationarity - a false premise that leads to strategy failure during regime changes.

## Research Genesis

### Initial Recognition
- Markets exhibit non-stationary behavior across multiple timescales
- Fixed thresholds create evaluation bias toward specific market conditions
- Static parameters fail during structural breaks, volatility shifts, and liquidity crises

### Panel of Experts Insight (Ultrathinking Framework)
Following the wisdom of "Quant of the Year Award" winners:

**Jean-Philippe Bouchaud**: Markets are complex adaptive systems requiring relative ranking against evolving distributions rather than absolute thresholds.

**Campbell R. Harvey & Marcos LÃ³pez de Prado**: Multiple testing bias demands dynamic adjustment of evaluation criteria. Static t-stats ignore selection bias across thousands of tested factors.

**Maureen O'Hara & Riccardo Rebonato**: Market microstructure changes constantly. Real implementation faces transaction costs, capacity constraints, and model decay that static backtests ignore.

**Petter Kolm**: Regime-dependent dynamic criteria using rolling window regime detection and Monte Carlo stress testing across market structures.

## Research Imperative

### Design Objective
Create **OHLCV-turning self-adaptive Nonparametric Predictive Alpha Factor (NPAF)** with **Self-Adaptive Generative Evaluation (SAGE)** that:

1. **Eliminates parameter dependencies** - No hardcoded thresholds or magic numbers
2. **Adapts to market regimes** - Self-adjusting evaluation criteria based on market state  
3. **Maintains robustness** - Viable across market variations, not just ideal formations
4. **Ensures practical viability** - Real-world implementation ready with transaction costs

### Key Research Questions

1. **How can evaluation frameworks become truly parameter-free?**
2. **What constitutes robust performance measurement across market regimes?**
3. **How do we build self-adaptive systems that discover their own evaluation criteria?**
4. **What are the state-of-the-art categorizations for parameter-free adaptive algorithms?**

## Research Direction Catalyst

The realization that even "improved" thresholds (Sortino > 2.5, t-stats > 5.0) perpetuate the same fundamental flaw - **any fixed threshold assumes stationarity**.

This led to the **paradigm shift**: From threshold-based evaluation to **self-evaluating, context-aware, regime-adaptive** assessment frameworks.

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Theoretical Framework**: Comprehensive taxonomy of parameter-free adaptive algorithms
2. **Practical Implementation**: NT-native NPAF/SAGE system conforming to NautilusTrader paradigms
3. **Validation Methodology**: Regime-resilient evaluation without arbitrary numerical bars
4. **Integration Pathway**: Clear implementation roadmap linking research to practical deployment

## Research Philosophy

**"The strategy should discover its own evaluation criteria from market structure rather than inherit our biases about what matters."**

This philosophy drives the search for truly adaptive, self-organizing trading intelligence that responds to market evolution rather than forcing markets to conform to predetermined expectations.
