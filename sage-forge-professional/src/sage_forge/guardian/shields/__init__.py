üõ°Ô∏è Guardian Shield Components: Multi-Layer Protection System

Shield components provide intuitive protection layers that any LLM agent 
can immediately understand as defensive barriers against TiRex vulnerabilities.

PROTECTION LAYERS:
- InputShield: Guards against malicious input attacks (NaN, inf, extreme values)
- CircuitShield: Protects against cascade failures with graceful fallbacks
- DataPipelineShield: Protects against data processing vulnerabilities (scaling, quantiles, tensor ops)
- OutputShield: Validates forecast outputs meet business logic requirements

Each shield is designed with intuitive naming and clear protective purpose.
