üõ°Ô∏è TiRex Guardian System: Comprehensive Protective Middleware

PROTECTIVE MIDDLEWARE: Acts as security barrier between application and TiRex model,
guarding against all empirically-validated vulnerabilities while ensuring business continuity.

The Guardian System shields against:
- NaN injection attacks (100% NaN input acceptance vulnerability)
- Infinity propagation attacks (causes model output corruption) 
- Extreme value injection (produces unrealistic forecasts)
- DoS/rate-limit attacks (overwhelming inference requests)
- Model failures and circuit breaking scenarios

Usage Pattern (PRODUCTION REQUIRED):
    from sage_forge.guardian import TiRexGuardian
    
    guardian = TiRexGuardian()  # The protective middleware
    quantiles, mean = guardian.safe_forecast(context, prediction_length)

Architecture:
    - shields/: Multi-layer protection components
    - detectors/: Threat and anomaly detection systems  
    - fallbacks/: Graceful degradation strategies
    - audit/: Comprehensive forensic logging

Empirical Basis:
    Based on comprehensive validation findings in:
    sage-forge-professional/docs/implementation/tirex/empirical-validation/
    
    Confirmed vulnerabilities: 8/8 attack vectors successful against raw TiRex
    Protection effectiveness: All known attacks mitigated through Guardian
