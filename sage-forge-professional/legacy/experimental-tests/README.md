# Experimental Tests Archive

**Purpose**: Experimental and one-off test scripts that were used for development exploration.

## Archived Files

### `test_tirex_finplot.py`
- **Origin**: Created during debugging session to test TiRex signal generation with FinPlot
- **Issue**: Attempted to use incorrect TiRex API (wrong initialization parameters)
- **Status**: Experimental test script - not part of main codebase
- **Archive Date**: August 2025
- **Reason**: No longer needed - proper TiRex demos exist in `demos/` directory

## Notes

These files were experimental explorations and are preserved for historical reference only.
