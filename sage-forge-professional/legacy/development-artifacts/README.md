# Development Artifacts Archive

**Purpose**: Log files and other artifacts generated during development that are no longer actively used.

## Archived Files

### Integration Test Logs
- `integration_test.log` - Original integration test output
- `integration_test_fixed.log` - Fixed integration test output
- **Archive Date**: August 2025
- **Reason**: Historical development logs - no longer needed for active development

## Notes

These artifacts represent snapshots of development progress and are preserved for historical reference. Current development should rely on active test suites and logging systems rather than static log files.
