# Phase 1 ODEB Success Sluices: Confidence Leak Problem Resolution

This document defines the granular success sluices for Phase 1 of the TiRex-Native ODEB implementation, breaking down the primary success gate (Confidence Leak Problem Resolution) into verifiable, sequential checkpoints.

## Overview

Phase 1 focuses on resolving the **Confidence Leak Problem (CLP)** where TiRex model confidence is lost during the flow from strategy signal generation to downstream ODEB analysis. The 6 success sluices build upon each other to establish end-to-end confidence preservation.

## Success Sluices

### Sluice 1A: Position Dataclass Enhancement
**Objective**: Extend Position dataclass with confidence and regime metadata

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Enhance `sage_forge.reporting.performance.Position` (lines 381-392)
- Add fields: `confidence`, `market_regime`, `regime_stability`, `prediction_phase`
- Maintain NT-compatible types and existing field structure
- Preserve backward compatibility with existing ODEB analysis

**Validation Criteria**:
- Position objects contain TiRex confidence at creation time
- Market regime information persists through position lifecycle
- Prediction phase tracking (WARM_UP_PERIOD → CONTEXT_BOUNDARY → STABLE_WINDOW)
- No breaking changes to existing performance reporting

**Dependencies**: None (foundational sluice)

### Sluice 1B: Confidence Flow Chain Validation
**Objective**: Validate confidence preservation from TiRex → Strategy → Position

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Create test framework tracking confidence through complete pipeline
- Validate TiRex prediction confidence matches final Position confidence
- Test confidence preservation during order execution and position creation
- Implement confidence audit trail logging

**Validation Criteria**:
- 100% confidence preservation accuracy (no leakage or corruption)
- Audit trail shows complete confidence flow chain
- Test coverage for all confidence manipulation points
- Regression tests prevent future confidence leaks

**Dependencies**: Sluice 1A (requires enhanced Position dataclass)

### Sluice 1C: Confidence Inheritance Oracle (CIA)
**Objective**: Implement oracle that inherits TiRex confidence distributions

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Create `ConfidenceInheritanceOracle` following NT configuration patterns
- Oracle inherits confidence distributions from TiRex model predictions
- Implement confidence-weighted position analysis
- NT-compatible config: `OdebOracleConfig(StrategyConfig, frozen=True)`

**Validation Criteria**:
- Oracle accurately inherits TiRex confidence distributions
- Confidence-weighted analysis produces statistically valid results
- Integration with existing ODEB framework without breaking changes
- Performance impact < 5% overhead on ODEB analysis

**Dependencies**: Sluice 1B (requires validated confidence flow chain)

### Sluice 1D: Regime-Aware ODEB Weighting (RAEW)
**Objective**: Weight ODEB analysis by regime stability and confidence

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Implement regime stability scoring using existing `_get_regime_multiplier()` pattern
- Weight ODEB efficiency calculations by regime stability × confidence
- Preserve existing regime classification system
- Maintain compatibility with current regime detection logic

**Validation Criteria**:
- ODEB analysis properly weighted by regime stability
- High-stability regimes receive higher analysis weight
- Confidence and regime stability multiplicative weighting
- No degradation in regime detection accuracy

**Dependencies**: Sluice 1C (requires Oracle with confidence inheritance)

### Sluice 1E: Temporal Causal Ordering Preservation (TCOP)
**Objective**: Maintain proper timeline without look-ahead bias

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Implement strict temporal ordering validation
- Ensure confidence/regime data only uses past information
- Validate prediction timestamps against bar timestamps  
- Create look-ahead bias detection framework

**Validation Criteria**:
- Zero look-ahead bias in confidence or regime assignments
- Temporal causality preserved throughout ODEB analysis
- Prediction data strictly precedes position execution data
- Validation framework catches temporal violations

**Dependencies**: Sluice 1D (requires regime-weighted analysis)

### Sluice 1F: Context Boundary Phase Management (CBPP)
**Objective**: Manage prediction phases for accurate ODEB analysis

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Implement phase detection: WARM_UP_PERIOD → CONTEXT_BOUNDARY → STABLE_WINDOW
- Phase-aware ODEB analysis with appropriate confidence scaling
- Integration with TiRex's 1-768+ bar prediction capability
- NT-compatible state management patterns

**Validation Criteria**:
- Accurate phase detection and transitions
- Phase-appropriate confidence scaling and analysis
- STABLE_WINDOW phase achieves >95% prediction reliability
- Integration with Multi-Horizon Trajectory Forecasting Capability (MHTFC)

**Dependencies**: Sluice 1E (requires temporal ordering validation)

## Implementation Sequence

Sluices must be implemented in dependency order: 1A → 1B → 1C → 1D → 1E → 1F

Each sluice builds upon the previous, creating a robust foundation for confidence preservation throughout the TiRex-NT-ODEB pipeline.

## Success Gate Completion

Phase 1 success gate is achieved when all 6 sluices pass validation with:
- >95% confidence preservation accuracy
- Zero temporal causality violations  
- Full integration with existing NT and ODEB frameworks
- No performance degradation in core functionality
