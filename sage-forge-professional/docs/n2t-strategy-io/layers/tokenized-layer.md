**Native TiRex Component**: `PatchedUniTokenizer.context_input_transform()`  
**Processing Flow**: `CONTEXT[single_series]` ‚Üí `StandardScaler.scale()` ‚Üí `_Patcher.patcher()` ‚Üí `tokenized_tensor` + `input_mask`  
**Architecture Reality**: **UNIVARIATE ONLY** - cannot process multiple features simultaneously

#### Executive Summary

**TiRex Architecture Reality**: Designed as univariate time series forecasting model

- **Input Requirement**: Single time series only (e.g., close prices)
- **Processing**: `input_patch_size * 2` = data + input_mask (NOT multi-features)  
- **Architecture Alignment**: Properly designed for single-variable forecasting
- **üìä EMPIRICAL VALIDATION**: All multi-dimensional inputs (`[1, 128, 5]`, `[128, 5, 1]`, etc.) fail with AssertionError

**Optimization Strategy**: Focus on **input quality** and **temporal features** within univariate constraint.

**üß™ VALIDATION STATUS**: ‚úÖ **EMPIRICALLY CONFIRMED** through comprehensive testing - [View Test Results](../../implementation/tirex/empirical-validation/TIREX_EMPIRICAL_FINDINGS_COMPREHENSIVE.md)

#### Current TOKENIZED Architecture ‚Äî Univariate Input Analysis

**Architecture Reality**: TiRex processes single time series (univariate)
**TiRex Component Usage**: `PatchedUniTokenizer` correctly processing single price series

| Input Option   | Type  | TiRex Processing                 | Formula              | Characteristics       | Status     |
| -------------- | ----- | -------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | ---------- |
| close          | float | `tokenizer.scale(close)`         | raw close prices     | Basic price series    | ‚úÖ VALID   |
| normalized     | float | `tokenizer.scale(zscore(close))` | zscore(close, win=T) | Stationary transform  | ‚úÖ VALID   |

**Architecture Constraints**:

- **Univariate Only**: TiRex architecturally limited to single time series input
- **No Multi-Feature Support**: Cannot process OHLCV, volume, or indicators simultaneously  
- **Single Variable Forecasting**: Outputs quantiles for same input variable only
- **Patch Processing**: Applies to temporal dimension, not feature dimension

**Optimization Focus**: Input quality and temporal preprocessing within univariate constraint.

#### Optimized TOKENIZED Architecture ‚Äî Univariate Input Enhancement

**Architecture Understanding**: `input_patch_size * 2` = data + input_mask (NOT multi-features)  
**TiRex Alignment**: Optimize single time series quality and preprocessing

##### Univariate Input Options (TiRex Compatible)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: TiRex can only process ONE of these options at a time, not simultaneously

| Input Series          | Type  | TiRex Processing               | Formula / Pseudocode                    | Use Case                |
| --------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **raw_close**         | float | `tokenizer.scale(close)`       | close prices                            | Direct price forecasting |
| **log_returns**       | float | `tokenizer.scale(log(close/close[-1]))` | `log(close[t]/close[t-1])`              | Return-based forecasting |
| **normalized_price**  | float | `tokenizer.scale(zscore(close))` | `(close - mean) / std`                  | Stationary forecasting   |
| **volume_weighted**   | float | `tokenizer.scale(vwap)`        | `sum(price * volume) / sum(volume)`     | Volume-adjusted price    |
| **typical_price**     | float | `tokenizer.scale(hlc3)`        | `(high + low + close) / 3`              | Representative price     |

**Architecture Constraint**: Choose exactly **ONE** series - TiRex cannot process multiple simultaneously

#### TiRex Native Component Integration ‚Äî Univariate Reality

##### PatchedUniTokenizer Correct Usage

```python
# CORRECT - TiRex univariate processing
tokenizer = PatchedUniTokenizer(patch_size=12, scaler=StandardScaler())

# Option 1: Raw close prices
close_series = torch.tensor(close_prices)  # Shape: [sequence_length]
tokenized_tensor, scaler_state = tokenizer.context_input_transform(close_series)

# Option 2: Log returns (often better for forecasting)
returns = torch.tensor(np.log(close_prices[1:] / close_prices[:-1]))
tokenized_tensor, scaler_state = tokenizer.context_input_transform(returns)

# IMPOSSIBLE - TiRex cannot do this:
# multi_features = torch.stack([close, volume, rsi], dim=-1)  # ‚ùå NOT SUPPORTED
```

##### StandardScaler State Management

```python
# Correct scaler_state for single time series
scaler_state = {
    'loc': mean_value,    # Scaling mean for univariate series
    'scale': std_value    # Scaling std for univariate series
}
# Shape: Single values, not arrays (because univariate)
```

##### Patch Processing Configuration

```python
# TiRex patch configuration for univariate financial data  
patch_config = {
    "patch_size": 12,         # 1 hour patches (12 √ó 5min bars)
    "patch_stride": 6,        # 50% overlap for continuity  
    "input_patch_size": 12,   # Temporal patch size (NOT feature count)
    "context_length": 288,    # 6 hours of 5-minute data
    "left_pad": True          # TiRex native padding
}
# Note: input_patch_size relates to temporal dimension, not features
```

#### Critical Evaluation Questions

**Univariate Input Selection**:

1. **Series Choice**: Raw close prices vs log returns vs typical price - which provides best TiRex forecasting?
2. **Preprocessing**: Static z-score vs regime-aware normalization - optimal for financial data?
3. **Data Quality**: How to handle gaps, outliers, and market halts in univariate series?

**TiRex Architecture Optimization**:

4. **Patch Configuration**: Optimal `patch_size` for financial time series (8, 12, or 16 timesteps)?
5. **Context Length**: Ideal sequence length for intraday forecasting (128, 256, or 512 timesteps)?
6. **Temporal Features**: Include session boundaries, weekend effects in single series?

**Multi-Model Strategy**:

7. **Ensemble Approach**: Run separate TiRex models for different assets/timeframes?
8. **Feature Engineering**: How to incorporate volume/volatility information AFTER TiRex forecasting?
9. **Integration**: Combine TiRex price forecasts with other specialized models for complete strategy?
